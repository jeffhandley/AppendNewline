# AppendNewline
Sublime package to easily add a new line after the current line **without moving the cursor**.

## Comparison to Default Mappings
Sublime has default mappings that are similar but importantly different.
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> add a new line after the current line and move the cursor to the new line
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> add a new line before the current line and move the cursor to the new line

**AppendNewline** differs as it adds a new line after the current line **without moving the cursor**.

## Keyboard Mappings
Place a newline at the end of the cursor's current line(s) (without moving the cursor) by pressing:
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> on OS X
+ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> on Windows and Linux
